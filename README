You need to install the Gosu game library first:

  gem install gosu

Note that you must also have the font 'Myriad Pro' installed. I believe that
this font is shipped with Photoshop. If you don't have this font then the game
will crash at some point.

You can also get rid of the 'Myriad Pro' dependency by editing wolf3d.rb
and changing the string 'Myriad Pro' to a more generic font, e.g. 'Arial'.

When you're done setting up the prerequisites, you can start the game with:

  ruby wolf3d.rb
